# 7‑Slide Demo Outline

1. **Title & Problem**
   - BioFusion Trash‑to‑Resource Reactor (BTR²)
   - Waste burden on long‑duration Mars missions (12,600 kg/crew of 8/3 years).

2. **Concept Overview**
   - Diagram: Trash → BioReactor + NanoDisassembly → Reuse feedstock
   - AI Manager orchestrates cycles.

3. **BioReactor**
   - Engineered extremophiles target plastics/textiles.
   - Output: polymer monomers + printable pellets.

4. **NanoDisassembly**
   - Mechano‑chemical separation of metals & ceramics.
   - Output: graded powders for repairs/3D printing.

5. **AI Manager**
   - Predicts demand, schedules runs, monitors safety.
   - Dashboard mockup & alerts.

6. **Impact**
   - Near‑zero waste, lower resupply mass, higher mission resilience.

7. **Closing**
   - Tagline: *“On Mars, nothing is trash.”*
   - Link QR/URL to project site.
