# BioFusion Trash-to-Resource Reactor (BTR²)

**Tagline:** On Mars, nothing is trash.

## Summary
During a three-year Mars mission, an eight-person crew would generate over **12,600 kg of inorganic waste** — packaging, textiles, and structural materials. Storing or returning this waste to Earth is costly and unsustainable.
Our project, **BioFusion Trash-to-Resource Reactor (BTR²)**, is a **hybrid recycling system** that fuses **synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and AI** to transform inorganic trash into usable feedstock for **3D printing, repairs, and construction** on Mars.
Engineered extremophile microbes “digest” plastics and fabrics, while a NanoDisassembly module separates metals and ceramics into reusable powders. An onboard AI monitors consumption patterns and directs autonomous recycling cycles.
BTR² turns waste into survival assets — enabling **near‑zero waste**, **reduced resupply mass**, and a more **sustainable human presence** beyond Earth.

## Quickstart (Project Link)
1. Create a new public GitHub repository named `BioFusion-BTR2`.
2. Upload **all** files from this bundle.
3. In repo Settings → Pages → Build and deployment: **Deploy from branch** (main) and set folder to `/root` or `/docs` (use `/site` path by turning it into the root: move `site/*` to repo root, or set Pages to use `main` and root then place `index.html` at repo root). Easiest: move files from `site/` to repo root **or** rename `site/` to `docs/`.
4. Wait for Pages to build, then copy the public URL (e.g., `https://<your-username>.github.io/BioFusion-BTR2/`) and paste it into the **Project Link** field on Space Apps.

### Alternative
Upload the `site/` folder to Google Drive and create a public link using "Open with → Google Drive Web server" or any static host (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
