“On Mars, nothing is trash. BioFusion BTR² turns packaging, textiles, and hardware scraps
into feedstock for repairs and 3D printing. Extremophile microbes digest plastics while a
NanoDisassembly module separates metals and ceramics. An onboard AI predicts demand and
orchestrates safe, autonomous cycles. BTR² cuts waste, reduces resupply mass, and boosts
mission resilience — transforming yesterday’s trash into tomorrow’s tools.”
