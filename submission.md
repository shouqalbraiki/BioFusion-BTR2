## 1) Summary (50–200 words)
During a three-year Mars mission, an eight-person crew would generate over **12,600 kg of inorganic waste** — packaging, textiles, and structural materials. Storing or returning this waste to Earth is costly and unsustainable.
Our project, **BioFusion Trash-to-Resource Reactor (BTR²)**, is a **hybrid recycling system** that fuses **synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and AI** to transform inorganic trash into usable feedstock for **3D printing, repairs, and construction** on Mars.
Engineered extremophile microbes “digest” plastics and fabrics, while a NanoDisassembly module separates metals and ceramics into reusable powders. An onboard AI monitors consumption patterns and directs autonomous recycling cycles.
BTR² turns waste into survival assets — enabling **zero-waste living, reduced resupply costs, and sustainable human presence beyond Earth.**

## 4) Project Details
**What it Does:** Converts inorganic waste (plastics, textiles, metals, ceramics) into reusable materials through microbial and nano‑mechanical processing managed by AI.  
**Benefits:** 95% waste reduction (target), lower resupply mass/costs, feedstock for in‑situ fabrication.  
**Intended Impact:** Self‑sustaining habitats with near‑zero waste.  
**Tools/Tech:** Python, MATLAB/COMSOL (simulation), BioPython, Blender (viz), NASA Open Data.  
**Creativity:** Cross‑disciplinary fusion of synbio + nanotech + AI.  
**Team Factors:** Modular design, autonomy, crew safety.

## 5) Use of AI
Prediction of waste streams, scheduling autonomous cycles, and generation of concept visuals (watermarked “AI Generated”).
